# Functions and Errors

This Solidity program demonstrates the implementation of a smart contract on a frontend with Next.js.

## Description

The program features the exchange of USD to Ethereum and vice versa. The `depositFromUsd()` function accepts an amount as parameter and deposits it to the account's current Ethereum balance. The `withdrawToUsd()` function accepts an amount as input and withdraws from the account's Ethereum balance to USD.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., CreateToken.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

//import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Assessment {
    address payable public owner;
    uint256 public balance;

    event Deposit(uint256 amount);
    event Withdraw(uint256 amount);

    constructor(uint initBalance) payable {
        owner = payable(msg.sender);
        balance = initBalance;
    }

    function getBalance() public view returns(uint256){
        return balance;
    }

    function depositFromUsd(uint256 _amount) public payable {
        uint _previousBalance = balance;

        // make sure this is the owner
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner of this account");

        // perform transaction
        balance += _amount;

        // assert transaction completed successfully
        assert(balance == _previousBalance + _amount);

        // emit the event
        emit Deposit(_amount);
    }

    // custom error
    error InsufficientBalance(uint256 balance, uint256 withdrawAmount);

    function withdrawToUsd(uint256 _withdrawAmount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner of this account");
        uint _previousBalance = balance;
        if (balance < _withdrawAmount) {
            revert InsufficientBalance({
                balance: balance,
                withdrawAmount: _withdrawAmount
            });
        }

        // withdraw the given amount
        balance -= _withdrawAmount;

        // assert the balance is correct
        assert(balance == (_previousBalance - _withdrawAmount));

        // emit the event
        emit Withdraw(_withdrawAmount);
    }
}

```

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.7" or newer, and then click on the "Compile CreateToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint or burn function. You can also check the values of the public state variables by clicking on them.
